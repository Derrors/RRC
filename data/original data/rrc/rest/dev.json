The wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings . The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the \" free \" appetizer of olives was disappointing . However , our main course was wonderful . I had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations . The dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions . When we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost . Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location . All in all , I would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .",

This is a twenty-something guy that does n't mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions . But $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include Wine ? Are you freaking kidding me ? Look , the appetizers were really good . The entree was also very good . Ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced . What you are paying for is the environment and the name . Yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while . $ 500 included : Drinks : 2 glasses of Dom Perignon at $ 35 each . Starters : Kobe Beef Sashimi . Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef . Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe . A beef Consomme . Entrees : Vanison steak and Bison Steak . Vanison was good but not amazing . Bison was quite excellent however . Dessert : pure disaster . Just not good at all . Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all . I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself , but may be it is worth it . I was wrong . The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say \" I 've been to the four seasons restaurant \" . I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it . All in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) . The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts . If you are going for the food , it will not be worth it . Yes , it is good , but I 've had better for cheaper . You would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no . Service was just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .",

I showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) . When the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I did n't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it . Yes , I ate the food , but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating , and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach . The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession . We paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more . I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .

They have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant . I have never been so disgusted by both food an service . For starters they delivered us someone else 's order . Fine , I wont hang you for that . However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin . Not one to jump to complaints ( hence my lack of previous online reviewing ) , I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations . My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation . None was made so i hung up . Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet . My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant . Not only have I worked in restaurants for many years , I am now in culinary school , I am a huge lover of oysters and fish , and my girlfriend is half Korean ! We know the difference between and oyster and bad fish . It was n't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive . Eat at your own risk .",

The hostess said \" Wow that 's a large group , unless you are n't together \" , to which I replied \" no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please . \" At first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us . The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions . There was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment . Not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with Brahma . The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) . The lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless . I believe there were 2 shrimp in the \" salt encrusted shrimp \" appetizer . After we ate our appetizers ( which took all of 8 minutes ) we ordered another round of Brahma 's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member . The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order . We replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay . She replied \" well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded . \" We called the other person who was very close by , and she told us to order for her , so we did . The food arrived in about 15 minutes . I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass ... which was very good . Everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi , seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice ! I heard the lobster roll was excellent . They seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done ( my sister still had her fork in hand ) . All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side , but fresh . Service not the friendliest to our \" large party \" ! Probably would not go back here .",

The Steak Tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table . Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm . Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value . It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area . Have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .",

I was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter . The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand . I ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food ! The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it ) . I could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table . She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables . I wish I could like this place more , and I wish someone would retrain the staff .",

It 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years . Each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return . As BFC does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later ! The frizzy retro girl ( with winged/ Dame Edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink . I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she \" had a BBQ to go to \" that night - WTF ? ? I 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely ! There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 \" with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about . I 'm a friendly person , so I would n't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal . Again , I 'd be super upset if that were my employee . Considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , I expect better service . So , if you 're walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who 's going to be seating you first ...",
