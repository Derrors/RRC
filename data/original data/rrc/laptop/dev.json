I bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room ; the two of us use it regularly . I wanted something that had a new Intel Core processors and HDMI port so that we could hook it up directly to our TV . The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features . The screen is bright and the keyboard is nice ; I find myself using the 10-key more than I thought I would . Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos . For those that care about noise this thing does n't really make any ; the i3 processor does n't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on . I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it . I wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff . Once I removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds . This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine ; my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that does n't require a dedicated video card . Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase . I looked around and based off my price/features comparison from a brand I trusted I landed here .",

That was my first Apple product and since then I have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs I have bought . My MacBook Pro is no exception . On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I did n't like the trackpad . Since I 've had this computer I 've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth . I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad . The display is incredibly bright , much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp . The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it ( iPhoto , iMovie , iWeb , iTunes , GarageBand ) is all very helpful as well . I also purchased iWork to go with it which has programs for word processing , spreadsheets , and presentations ( similar to Microsoft Office ) . I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well . I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality !",

During that time , I had to send it back 3 times . I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me . None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing . They would repair one thing , send it back and it would still have the same problem . The processor went on me , the fan went and the motherboard went . I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused , because they knew it was trouble . I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty . I took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty . I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT . I waited and waited and no laptop . Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box . I waited another month for approval and for them to \" BUILD \" me a new laptop . I was psyched . I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer would n't go onto our wireless network and I would n't have the same problems because it was updated . Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing . HP did n't fix it . I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one . I use my friends and family 's $ 2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and HP , well , I 'll never buy or recommend an HP to anyone !",

I bought a protector for my key pad and it works great : ) This is definitely a computer worth the money ; The mouse is a little bit different than what you 're used to though- it has one big flat panel and one full bar ( instead of two separate ones ) to click with- but you get used to it quite quickly . AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer ( when they have a certain promotion/offer going , of course ) ! Overall , this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from . The Apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you : ) Obviously , this Macbook is P-E-R-F-E-C-T for me because it does exactly what I need in an easy-to-function way .

All you have to do is turn it on and it works . It is very durable , I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet . I do n't do any high tech stuff on it , just write papers , check mail , and sometimes play games , so I ca n't reccomend it if you are in the computer field . But if you are in the computer field you probably would n't be here . : ) In the past four years I 've had it I have never once gotten a virus . I did have to replace the battery once , but that was only a couple months ago and it 's been working perfect ever since . I would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use , stylish , fun , awesome computer . Also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable , easy to use computer . Hope this helped !",

It just works flawlessly ! Its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action . Dells are ok , HPs are n't that good , but Macs or Fantastic . I honestly love my mac , thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict .

The problem I had with this unit was unresolvable . It had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use , and would not move past this error . I realize that not every unit has this issue , but the ones that do can not be repaired . I acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card , but still requires a return . Instead of taking another chance on Toshiba , I went with an Asus G73JH-x3 . They offer the best warranty in the business , and do n't 3rd party it out like Toshiba . For the same price , you get a lot more in the Asus ... .1920x1080 res./ awesome cooling system/ much better grafics card ( ATI 5870 ) / 8GB RAM/ LED backlit screen ...

They gave me a hard time yet again , but their was a malfunction in the battery itself , it did n't die . THEN , one month after the warranty expired , the replacement charger went . I had to pay $ 100 for a universal charger for this cheap $ 300 laptop . Not worth it one bit . The people are frustrating to work with , the product itself is very cheaply made , and the accessories are less than satisfactory . Also , my sister got the exact same laptop ( since they were so cheap ) and after 8 months , the screen split in half just from everyday use . Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth , they come loose . And it is impossible to get them back in .",

I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements , but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased . So I 'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority . The only thing I did n't learn in my research was the software I would need like privacy protection and warranty protection , in case it gets broken , or crashes etc . I do n't have that additional money right now , and therefore would n't have purchased it at this time . Those things are very important - vital even ! So think about factoring those things in when you purchase . I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I wo n't have to worry about a crash . I will have to purchase Spy ware or Nortell for privacy protection . Thank you .",
