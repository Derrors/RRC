It even has a great webcam , and Skype works very well . The fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine . The Windows 7 Starter is , in my opinion , a great way to think about using your netbook : basics , basics , basics . I wiped nearly everything off of it , installed OpenOffice and Firefox , and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price . This netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop ( my wife and I have another laptop ) , or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks . I use this for my tutoring business , and since I 'm always bouncing from student to student , it is ideal for portability and battery life ( yes , it gets the 8 hours as advertised ! ) . Finally , I should note that I took the 2GB RAM stick from my old EeePC and installed it before I even powered on for the first time . ASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks , and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them .",

The Final Cut Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy , and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer , which is also a mac . I would buy one of these for every person in my office if I could . In my line of work , I often have to take work home , and this makes it so easy . I do transcription work on the side , and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well . The apple care has never failed me , and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well .

In two months , both the power cord pin broke ( the company replaced it ) and then the CD drive literally jumped out of the laptop unannounced and shattered into a million pieces . In addition , no matter what I do to change the settings , add/delete Flash , etc. , Firefox hangs on start-up . It seems like Lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on . The cords always feel like they are in my way . One positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard , which is larger than usual . It 's a pleasure to type on . My final thoughts : if you are a Mac user , stay away . If you want to travel with this laptop , do n't buy it . It 's clunky , heavy , and a pain to start up and shut down . If you have zero dollars , consider it . If you want ease of use and long-term happiness , buy a Macbook .",

It pretty much does everything we could ever need , and looks great to boot . Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things , they always come up with good looking products .

My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership , so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan . After a couple of years , my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery . In the three years I 've had my MacBook Pro , I have never had a virus on my computer , and I do a lot of work on the internet . While there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down , this occurs far less frequently than on PC computers and laptops that I 've used . The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product . I highly recommend this product !

If a website ever freezes ( which is rare ) , its really easy to force quit . Never been hacked . No viruses . I have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free , even without the warranty . A mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense . Its also FUN to use ! The programs are great , like iphoto ( love the editing capabilities ) , imail ( which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad ) , imovie , etc . My sister has the same Mac as me and she is in a band and uses GarageBand to record and edit . She said its very user friendly . I have had another Mac , but it got slow due to an older operating system . However , I love this particular Mac because its very fast , great size , and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad . I am very happy I bought this Mac , well worth the extra money .",

The display is beyond horrible . I can not even read what I am writing half of the time . There are so many things wrong with this product , it just makes me want to set my self on fire !

I know there are way better laptops out there for the same price , and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls . Not to mention it has shit gigs . I could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage .

The Windows 8.1 used to boot in just 2s and that was freaking awesome . Now I have dual booted my laptop to Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 and it 's not got too slow either . I am loving it completely . It does make a little noise but that 's alright as it 's not too much . It does n't get heated up much even after continuous usage . But the touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever I am typing , my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it 's really annoying . I prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad , i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else . HP please fix it . A smaller touchpad would make life easier for Computer Science students or IT people much more easier .",

It makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier . It is also very lightweight , making transporting this computer very easy . The graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid . The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver , much easier than any other computer I have ever owned . I use iphoto all the time , which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike . The program came with the computer and works beautifully .

I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed . Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and I am not kidding you , I called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them . It 's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them . And at one point , they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop ( I bought the memory stick they recomended ) . Long story short , since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one , I did n't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop , but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year , they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services , they finally gave in . Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba ? Probably not ever again . I 'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba . Remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product .",

It has many great programs , such as ILife , iPhotos and others . iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft Office so you can send and receive files from a PC . In addition , all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations . This comes in very handy for me as an educator . iPhotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos . It allows you to automatically upload photos to your Facebook account with one click . In addition , there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture . If you are looking for something reliable , this is the laptop for you . Even though it is much more expensive than many PC laptops , it is worth the price .",

Two times with in one month . I am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so\u00a0carrying\u00a0it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little , while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it .

Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time . This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped . Asked the customer service rep . If it 's not shipped on the next business day , called on a Friday they are closed on weekends , what was the next step . The rep did not even answer my question , I had to ask him , if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he did n't even try to acknowledge my question . Was searching online for a power supply when I found this site . I 'm tired of the inept service . If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS ! ! ! Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you ca n't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small . I 'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE . HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK ! ! ! I spoke with a service rep at Micro Center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter , so it 's not just an isolated incident ! ! !",

This computer does n't do that well with certain games it ca n't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games . Oh and if thats not bad enough it does n't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $ 25 for two cds . the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop .",

The touchpad has n't worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning , I thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads I 've worked with have some inherent oddities . This one however , is now very loose and I have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work , Then suddenly , I can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own . Today , it has n't worked at all more than it has . The laptop has 4G and a 2.9g processor and it 's slower than the four year old Toshiba I replaced . It hangs , freezes and just is n't working properly . I have now been waiting almost a minute for the computer management window to open ! Though I do n't have much installed , I only have 96 of the 278G left ! I have no idea what 's taking up all the room , it does n't make sense . Most of my things are stored in the cloud . I could go on and on , but suffice it to say , if you want to spend $ 400+ on a laptop , do n't buy this one ! It 's definitely not worth the money .",

Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $ 175 to send it in to fix it . That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $ 175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $ 175 and it was fixed . It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back . ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke . I babyed the heck out of it and i still do . To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk . The graphics are great . The internet speed is spectacular . The battery life is probably an hour at best . Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good . I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about . I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month .",

Trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything , so I want to manage my time I do have to be the most efficient . I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college . I use the computer to basically check emails , surf the web , print coupons and for my college papers . I was getting extrememly frustrated when I would want to do these simple taks that I would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my PC . It would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and I would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow . My brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an Apple . Finally , I could n't take it anymore and ordered my Apple . Yes , I thought the expese was a little much , but I now realize you get what you pay for . I love my Apple , it is quick and easy to use . I 've had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful , english speaking ( from Vancouver ) techs that walked me through the processes to help me . I ca n't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket . Money and time well spent ! Highly recommended !",

I built my own gaming pc with a intel i5-4590 in it and a gtx 760 so I know what crazy performance on a computer can come to . However , this laptop far exceeded my expectations when I bought it for college , I only use Malwarebytes and Microsoft Security Essentials , run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years . For $ 250 , which is as much as my graphics card alone cost , this laptop is an incredible value . It is quite impressive at multitasking , which really surprised me . I can have tabs open while playing YouTube videos and it handles it impressively well . BUT I should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen , it 's certainly good enough for the average person , but if you 're used to good screens this may bother you a bit , but it 's certainly not unbearable by anyone 's standards . If you want to game , this thing can handle League of Legends on medium-low settings , but I certainly would n't recommend it for gaming . Overall , a great laptop for simply doing basic things and web-browsing . Would definitely recommend for those who are \" technologically ignorant \"",

I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems ! The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets , and rather quickly too . I 'm hoping that I can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross . I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program . Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac !

I even got my teenage son one , because of the features that it offers , like , iChat , Photobooth , garage band and more ! We are addicted to the Mac .

No , tey do n't even support their own bios and it \" could be a problem with the bios \" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity ? ? ! !

The computer was shipped to their repair depot\u00a0 on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned . I called their repair depot as was told they would send Me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot . They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place . The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba . The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue . Instead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air ? to Louisville Ky . By Air sounds more like by truck to Me . And Toshiba is totally unconcerned . The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter . We do n't Mind and You do n't Matter . I would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter . When it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you do n't matter .",

But to be honest , I do n't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming . So this was great for me . It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs . Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work . I also travel with it and it never gives me any problems . It was also cheaper than the Pro which made it even more appealing to me . Sadly Apple has discontinued this MacBook , I think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller Pros . But I am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it . I look forward to years of use , it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well .",

It may take a little getting used to but you do n't have to worry about viruses or other headaches . Not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs . I am ADDICTED to photo booth ! It is SO much fun to play with . I work with kids and they love making short videos on there . I am able to organize my pics , music and files easily . If you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac !",

It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard ! the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one . the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon ! pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were . i love the size of the computer since i play games on it . i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have . also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard . So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer",

Good bye BLUE SCREEN and Critical errors ! ! ! ! Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too . I can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner . My Iphone synced right up just like a person would expect , unlike the PCs in our lives . If only Bill Gates would read some of what is said here MS would do a better job . If your time is worth anything to you , if you are tired of rebooting , reformatting , reinstalling , trying to find drivers , if you want a computer to work for you for a change , make the change to this computer .

Once open , the leading edge is razor sharp . This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design . Using this machine is like a mild form of torture . In the shop , these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it , get it home , break the seal and use it ( very clever con ) . The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare . I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening . Also , the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it . I hate to say this , but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back , then I would . It is absolutely horrible to use , despite all its so called advanced features . I regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use . Buy this if you like being tortured , teased , frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac . It 's a bummer and one out of five is being kind . My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary . I 'm going to try and keep my old G4 on the road for as long as possible . In due course , I 'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash .",

It is much faster than my desktop which is a Core2 Quad running at 2.83 GHz . It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine . I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers . It is a bit heavy . It would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required . If that is the case for you , I would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases . Had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in . This is an over-sized , 18-inch laptop . Most of the large bags are for a 17 inch . You may need to special order a bag . It would n't fit in most 17-inch bags . I was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard does n't light up on this model . It also does not have bluetooth . Pay attention to the specs if you want these options . You 'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them . I should have been more observant . I was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing , I took it for granted that these features were standard . They are not . Overall , still a very nice machine . Boots up fast and runs great ! I 'm pleased .",

Its fast , has High definition quality in the videos . The pictures are clear as can be . If I had to buy another computer , I would most definetly buy an acer one computer . Heck , if I had enough ' money , I would but it as a gift for someone . Im glad that it has such great features in it . It also came with a built it web cam which is great because I can see an communicate with my family members back home . Clear picture on it and everything . The one down side to it is that when I play a certin game on here , it tends to freeze up sometimes , but thats the only bad thing about this computer . The acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it , but I like the big screen on it . Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies . Im very happy with this computer !",

That is how it is able to function better than any other PC . I have recommended this laptop to everyone I know who is buying one . I like it so much , I bought another just for my wife .",

The reviews at the time in late July 2014 were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost 4 star review ... The first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus . Now the graphics are not HD ... and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic ( medium low grade ) plastic . So if you do n't have kids , or not in high school or do n't accidently sit on it , it should be fine . Now the speed is disappointing . Start up is fine maybe 20 secs at most , but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times . Even for a 4GB RAM it barely chugs with 3 tabs open . I tried all the Window updates ( this worked for a couple of HP laptops I7in that I bought later at BB ) to see if it could remove the drag , it did not . Really at this point I am trying to confirm if the RAM can be upgraded to see if I can do that to help . Couple that with lack of inbuilt Bluetooth , dvd drive you are looking at a close tie ( or even a loss ) compared with the other laptops on sale in mid to late August 2014 . The HP laptops 17in ( with i3 core and AMD ) I mentioned before from the other big electronic BB store smoked this one even before I updated windows and upped the RAM . But alas they were gifts ... and what is a gift if not given ? All in all I wish I had waited a bit . But then again hindsight is 20/20 . Bought a usb dvd rW drive but have not used it yet .",

I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem . Well , I started using Google Chrome , which is a little better , but it freezes too sometimes . This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update , so if you do n't save your files and information , everything will be lost . Another issue I have with it is the battery . Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden . There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle , and when I click on it it says : \" Consider replacing your battery \" and it does not hold full charge . It is not even a year old yet , so I would\u00a0definitely not recommend it to anyone . Do n't waste your money !",

The ATI graphics card is a huge plus , definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with , such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft . My one complaint with this laptop is that I 've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in . This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components , and I 'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator , but I still expected better product quality for this price range . Other than that , I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities .",

Very long-life battery ( up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings ) . I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home , and it runs just fine . I play a lot of casual games online , and the touchpad is very responsive . The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16 \" laptop does . I would n't play a first-person shooter with this , mind , but if you wanted to run MS Office , email , chat , download a video , listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store , and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in , I 'd highly recommend checking this out . The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook : screen size is not something I 'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week . Additional caveat : the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user 's liking .",

Pretty much every major game save for Solitare wo n't even play on it due to the slower processor . Its also worth noting that there no bluetooth , no mircophone jack , no ethernet , no dvd/cd drive/burner , and no usb 3.0 ports . It DOES come with two usb 2.0 ports , a hdmi port , and a webcam . The webcam is nothing special , its there if you need it . Do n't expect it to take good pictures or video . The battery is pretty soild . It lasts up to 5-6 hours with normal use . The computer itself runs very quiet and is mostly cool to the touch . The only major negative to me is Windows 8.1 ( though YMMV ) and the Dell crapware installed . I would strongly recommend to remove it and install Windows 7 on it with a usb drive . The performance will improve on it . Trust me .",

The 13 \" MacBook Pro is portable , durable , and very capable . It has a 10 hour battery life when you 're doing web browsing and word editing , making it perfect for the classroom or office , and in terms of gaming and movie playing it 'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours . It 's also very energy efficient , running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb . It 's graphics are n't bad at all , for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum , easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics . It 's also very capable of doing moderate video editing ( although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing ) . The operating system and user interface is very intuitive , and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing . Typically , when I purchase a new laptop I always end up using an external mouse for convenience . However , the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary ( unless you 're gaming ) . Still , this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work . They also have a longer service life than other computers ( I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks ) .",

Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture . English must have been his third or fourth language . His language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test , and it was failing . after trying to get some help he disconnected on me . After that I turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid . After 4 days , being denied 6 times and told off once , I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt . After that the said it was under warranty . Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me . After they found no other way , they told me to courier it to them ( since they do n't allow the use of the post office ) at my expense , and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it would n't be covered . I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me . They really do have the worlds very worst repair service .",

It was very easy to just pick up and use -- It did not take long to get used to the Mac OS . ( I had been a Windows/Linux user before this ) I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for ( Internet , artwork ) , and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable . There are several programs for school or office use ( Pages , Numbers , Keynote , etc . ) , music ( Garageband ) , photo management ( Photo Booth , iPhoto ) , video-editing or movie-making ( iMovie ) , etc . The built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services . iTunes is a handy music-management program , and it is essential for anyone with an iPod . The neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons . All-in-all , I would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone .",

It 's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box . If you want a little more custom ability , drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of Win 7 and grab a 2GB stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more . ( I found a 2GB stick for a bit under $ 50 ) Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours , or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents . My ONLY issues are : the screen/video resolution wo n't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60 That being said , it still runs video in full screen decently . The sound is a bit quiet if you 're on a plane , this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones . Bottom line , I doubt you 'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine .",

Its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer . For example , when my husband turns the light out while I 'm on the computer . the screen brightness automatically adjusts . The keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard . It is VERY easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted . Oh , it is such a great piece of equipment . One suggestion I do have , is to not bother getting Microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a PC . Its Office compatible , but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs . Having someone give you a quick tour of how to 's is the best . So you do n't get frustrated the first few weeks .",

The LED backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more . I 'm learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages . Granted , it 's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops , my Mac boots up noticeably quicker . A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect . They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I 'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular . I 'm excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same . It 's more expensive but well worth it in the long run .",

Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone . So I called customer support ( which is good too ) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all , I just chose to hide the message . I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it , I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use . Also the speakers are not very loud , But it is a netbook . Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though .",

This is my second MacBook . The first one I had was a 2006 model , not the Pro . I fell in love with it . This one has had the same effect . I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion , so I kind of knew what I was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features . The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual , but substantive . The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior . The Unibody construction is solid , sleek and beautiful . It is everything I 'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint , but somehow a bit more sturdy . For the not so good , I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy . It 's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook . The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me ( I prefer it dark ) or if you can crank up the brightness . My real problem with it ? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie . I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it . The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours . Enabling the battery timer is useless . The \" Time remaining \" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes . It 's a joke . It 's so bad that I 'm thinking I only got half a battery or something . I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like . This ai n't it . My only other complaint is that it gets really hot . : - ) If you buy this - do n't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life , and you 'll be perfectly satisfied .",
