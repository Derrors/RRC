Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate d\u00e9cor will make you feel like you \u2019 re no longer in the city . If you \u2019 re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you \u2019 ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) . It \u2019 s just you and your date and an occasional cute \u2018 excuse me \u2019 before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth ! My party had the BBE $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake ! I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it . We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche . Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce . I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better . The entrees were served with miso soup and rice . The sake \u2019 s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world . For desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal . Maybe it was the great company ( I had friends visiting from Philly \u2013 yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but I just can \u2019 t say enough good things about this brasserie . I don \u2019 t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but I \u2019 ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .",

Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly , but I can say this is one of the best I 've had . Very \" normal Indian food \" , but done really well . I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel . Also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ . I do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) . But if you 're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for Indian food",

The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews . Well ... they can run but they ca n't hide . I live in the West Village and I 've been to a lot of restaurants . Sometimes you pay a lot and do n't get much in return - it 's manhattan , things are expensive . However , most of them are at least prompt and pleasant . This place ... god where do i begin . It is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that . The decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo n't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME ! ! ! !

IT WAS HEAVEN ! Aside from the Sea Urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro ( Fatty Tuna ) , Sea Eel , etc . The sake menu should not be overlooked ! All in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city . Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .",

My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms . We arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy . We ordered our appetizers , I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon . Everything was going good until we got our meals . I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled . It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes . My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de-skinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat . I took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and I have never , in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms . At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away . So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it . I could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach . I 've had better chicken at BBQs ! ! ! ! So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible . Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , \" oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier \" No apology , nothing . After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! No desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! ! I was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager . This is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it . Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! ! We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore . The level of rudeness was preposterous . The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out . I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE .

They were such a rip-off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying . The rest of the dim sum , though pricey by Chinatown standards , is worth it . Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table . The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for Chinatown ) alternative . A few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards . These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner : ( 1 ) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard ( 2 ) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal .",

The restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated . Most of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive . The atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd , but there were a few groups of mid 20's/30 year olds also . The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the food was excellent ! Me and my girls will definitely go back .",

The bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n't even close to sizzling . Too bad I had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl . The nakgi-bokum was horrible . Easily the worst stir-fried squid I 've ever tasted . The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean . The side dishes were passable , and I did get a refill upon request . The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service . I mentioned the squid dish was n't very good when the waitress visited . She just nodded and walked off . There were no communications issues either , as she spoke perfect English . As to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made . My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish . We were charged full price . If you ware looking for Korean fusion , I suggest you try some of the places in the East Village . Authentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street , of course .",

The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention . Polite acknowledgement is out ; supercilious scorn is in . And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ? A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) . Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest . The place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list ( I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins ) At $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture . On that scale , it 's a world-beater .",

The wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous ( in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b @ # $ * way ) . The food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries . But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the BTs . You can get a completely delish martini in a glass ( that 's about 2 1/2 drinks ) for $ 8.50 ( I recommend the Vanilla Shanty , mmmm ! ) in a great homey setting with great music . The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests . You ca n't go wrong with this place .",

The food we ordered was excellent , although I would n't say the margaritas were anything to write home about . Our waitress was n't mean , but not especially warm or attentive either . I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though . Maybe it has improved since then ?

My quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor . And $ 11 for a plate of bland guacamole ? Come on . Do n't get me started on the margaritas , either . Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila . Really , I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds -- this , in the city of a million restaurants , at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one . Save your money and your time and go somewhere else . Oh , and I never write reviews -- I just was so moved by how bad this place was , I felt it was my duty to spread the word .",

The service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served . The waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing . After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : Where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in America ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on . We did tip , I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager . The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .",

The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree . I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) . Anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , I would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari . The decor is night tho ... but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .",

Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th . The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced . Slightly above average wines start at $ 70+ with only one selection listed at $ 30+ . Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category . For instance , plates were just dumped on the table , I was handed the wine list upside down , etc ... . Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service . To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .",

I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience . I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time . We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different . Our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience ! And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience . We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table . Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes . We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited . The place is beautiful ! The hostess was very pleasant . However , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible ! Once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed ! Since we were already waiting so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it . Our experience did not ever get any better . For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink . We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka . After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner . We asked for beverages and never received them . We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order . My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin . I would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner . By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka ! What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received ! The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses ! To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant . By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers ! If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible ! I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money . MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly ! I wish I COULD be refunded !",
