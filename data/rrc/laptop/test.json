After not having a disc player I have actually noticed that I never used this disc play in my old laptop either . However if you really need a disc player Apple sells one that connects to your USB port . I love the new high retina display , and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter . Overall , this is a fast , light , practical computer and I highly recommend it .",

I bought this pc to play games and stream movies ! it could handle all of that but my friend wanted me to put some music on a cd ! I could see the disk drive on the side but it did n't seem to have a button on it ? strange . So I look all over the internet and I checked the settings and there was nothing . So I looked in the manual and what do I find ? A DISK DRIVE WITH BUTTONS ON IT ! ! ! ! ! ! So I called customer support and the man asked for the serial number . I gave it to him . And he said this computer does not have a disk drive and I was furious ! So beware buyer , this computer has a useless piece of plastic on it . Thank you asus .

However , a few things are immediately occurring to me I had read the other reviews here on amazon , but decided the specs and appearance looked good enough to go ahead . Well , my first impressions are that its OK , it certainly boots up quickly ( thanks SSD ! ) , and from the limited use so far ( no games ) its fast enough in normal usage . It certainly looks nice , but that nice dark blue top is a fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out . Also I have found the touch pad to be awkward to use ( could be I am pressing too hard perhaps ) , and the screen is well underwhelming . To be honest I am a little disappointed and considering returning it . If that changes I will add an update to this .",

Was the best decision we ever made. It runs just as fast as the day we got it with no problems ! We do n't have to de-frag , deliete cookies , run security programs , or any of the common PC problems that have to be delt with in order to keep you running and up to speed . You ca n't get a virus on Mac , so in the long run the cost of the Mac is saved by not buying security , and not having to replace your computer every year or two . We have had our desktop for around four years . My wife has had her Macbook pro going on three years , and I just purchaced My Macbook pro this year . Never had any issues , no frustrations just great easy wireless , all in one fun !",

This MBP is clean , neat , and simple . I like that . It takes less time to power up , and if you just close the case it go into sleep mode . WHen you open it wakes up almost immediately . Very nice . I am pleased with my decision , however I have only had this for a few weeks . There are a few things I am dissappointed with though . Only 2 USB ports . Most Windows laptops have 2 to 4 or more . No HDMI port . Most Windows laptops have at least 1 . The headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone . Not a big deal for me , but if you Skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a Mac . These are about twice the price of an equivilant Windows machine so it was a tough decision , but like I said I am pleased so far ... ..",

It 's 15.6 inches , which for me is not too big nor too small . It has the latest i7 CPU with a GTX 950M for GPU , which makes this laptop blazing fast ( boots up in under 5 seconds , with the help of the SSD of course ) . - It has 256GB SSD which is just enough for my OS , games , documents , and anything in between . It also has an extra bay for an extra HDD if you wish to add one . - It 's not touchscreen ! How I hate laptops with touchscreen . I do n't have to pay extra for what I hate , I mean seriously , who types with their laptops and occasionally reaches out to the screen to tap it ? - Its keyboard is nicely arranged , silent , and back-lit which is nice , but what I do n't like about it is the material attracts oil from your fingers . I have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good . - This laptop is so silent , its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load , thanks to the 5th generation Intel core which draws less power , thus less heat . - It 's comfortable to have it on my lap , because the weight is evenly distributed to he laptop 's body and not accumulated on the screen like most \" hybrid \" ones do . - It can run games really well . Well , not really well . MOBAs like Dota 2 and SMITE can be run on max quality settings with 60 fps or more . Medium settings on titles like Tomb Raider for it to be acceptable ( 60 fps is the minimum acceptable fps # pcmasterrace ) . - It 's lightweight and easy to carry around . - The screen is a matte 1080p display , which is nice , but with poor viewing angle . I find myself adjusting it regularly . - It looks sleek and gorgeous . Blends in with any accessory you use with it . All in all I am very happy with this purchase . And with this price , I do n't think you can buy anything better .",

It wakes in less than a second when I open the lid . The screen has an extremely high resolution that I 'm very pleased with .

I 'm not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand $ 129 for a new battery , $ 39 to replace it and $ 139 for a new keyboard . I could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so I went to the Apple store myself and asked for a manager . He explained to me the battery expansion is 'normal ' . Apple does n't cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their Apple Care . The battery is simply considered 'consumable ' and NOT covered . I asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the MacBook Air on the internet with the description that Apple does n't consider the product defective . His reply astonished me , looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said : 'Make sure you have your facts straight before you smear ! They will contact you . ' He did n't specify who are 'they ' but from the tone of his voice and his 6'5 ' posture it indicated something between the SWAT team and a bunch of LAWYERS . Here is my take on all of this , the business model Apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from China , hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school , call them geniuses , and bully everybody who complains about their product . Steve Jobs is dead , so is Apple . No more Apple devices in my household . Please Google 'MacBook battery bulge explode ' before you buy your next Apple toy .",

                    "context": "I purchased this laptop back in June 2015 after doing a lot of research on different laptops I was interested in . While I have only ever owned HP laptops , I made sure to look into other brands , including Asus , Dell , and Microsoft . However , the HP Envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more . I have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all . While the price may seem high , it is worth every penny with its many perks . The Pros : A Ton of Storage Space- This laptop comes with 8GB of memory and a 1 TB ( 1000GB ) hard drive . That is plenty of space for your laptop , which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers . I really enjoy having all of the extra space , especially coming from a laptop with only 500GB of hard drive space . 2-in-1 Capability- The ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus . If you are looking to get a 2-in-1 laptop , this is the laptop you should consider . I love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like a tent and watch movies , without having the keyboard in the way of things . However , the physical keyboard is much nicer than the detachable ones found on other laptops and tablets . I find it much easier to type on and much more durable . Battery Life- My battery life is really good with this laptop and I have had no problems with it thus far . I can usually go about 10 hours before I get down to 10 % battery life . My last laptop had terrible battery life , lasting only about an hour on a full charge , so this is n't too shabby at all for a laptop . The Cons : No Disc Drive- Call me old fashioned , but I still enjoy listening to physical CDs and uploading them to iTunes . However , I can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive . While it is entirely possible to buy a disc drive , I do not feel like it is something I absolutely need . If you are an avid CD listener though or want to watch DVDs from your laptop , I would suggest buying the separate disc drive . Overall , I definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop . The touchscreen and 2-in-1 capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes . It also is nice to be able to play Candy Crush or Angry Birds when in between classes straight from your laptop . It makes it much more exciting to play !",

It is an older model , so know that upfront , but it is everything I was looking for . I wanted a laptop that had a CD drive , since most new laptops do not have one , a laptop with an actual hard drive , since the new MacBooks do not , and I wanted to get away from PCs . I actually spent $ 600 on a PC before I bought this MacBook and returned it with 24 hours because it was slow , and I could not stand windows 10 . From the moment I received this MacBook it was like a dream come true . It is a little sluggish , which was to be expected with the 4GB ram , but even at its sluggish it is faster than the PC I bought . I know once I upgrade the ram to 8GB it will pick up a lot . As an added bonus I plan on upgraded to 16GB down the road , but 8 will do for now . The price for the ram is about $ 80 so this lap top is still cheaper than a brand new MacBook . Also , if after reading some reviews and doing some research I found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus . So long story short , if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop . I know people were complaining that it is n't the newest model , but it all depends on what you are looking for . It 's the perfect size for someone who is using a laptop for school or everyday use , and while it is a little heaver than the MacBook Air , at 5ish pounds , its really not that bad . I highly recommend ! !",

Most system now a days have something great but miss something that you will be looking for . Pros : 1 . Nice Looks . If you ca n't afford a MacBook get this one : ) 2 . Keyboard is great 3 . I did n't wanted a 4K or a touch display for laptop . I wanted a simple Full HD display and this one does its job 4 . Sound is great 5 . And this has a extra slot for HDD 6 . No CD drive . Who uses one these days . Cons : 1 . Web cam . VGA really ASUS ? ? You do n't want to show this to anyone : ) . Anyway I do n't use webcam much so , I do n't care 2 . Viewing angles are not great . 3 . Remember its a dual core . 4 . The fan kicks in even its not too hot . 5 . I found the track pad not great . I use my mouse so not a problem for me . Over all very good system and worth it . Wonder its hard to get .. Getting sold on a higher price in Amazon . ASUS always shows sold out .",

I 've used the Pairing Tool , which is located in the Windows directory . I even ran it as Administrator -- still no effect . I used the Ctrl-Esc keys while turning on , and still nothing . It 's charged , the light comes on . It flickers briefly to green before the light goes out . I upgraded to Windows 8.1 , and repeated the sequence on software loads . I still ca n't pair it . I do n't want to carry around a bluetooth keyboard for a computer whose keyboard is nonfunctional . I may give it one more shot tonight , then I 'm returning it to the vendor . I will update it if I get it working with the procedure . I 'm not playing the game of send in a computer or wait for a new keyboard , while my return window is still open . Sony can eat the cost from the seller on this one while I get my money back for a DEFECTIVE product . Others have posted about this keyboard issue . But Sony does n't seem to have addressed it . UPDATE : after the hassle of a return , waiting in line , then sitting around the store to allow the computer and keyboard to charge sufficiently , I was able to obtain a keyboard which was paired out of the box with the computer .",

This ASUS you 're looking at right here , and that I 'm typing on right now , has one . - With that being said , for the price ( $ 800 ! ) , you get a nice fast laptop , but if you ask me , it 's missing some things that I feel should be automatically included : This laptop has no : - Touchscreen - Optical Drives ( OK , a bit of a stretch , because that would eat up precious space in this monster ) - Swivel or detachable screen What this laptop does have is : - Windows 8 , which is confusing as all get-out - Tons of \" bloatware \" ; .

It 's a steal when considering the specs and performance as well . The processor and GPU are fantastic at running games and multiple apps . I can run most games to a good quality without seeing any lack of speed . The backlit keyboard is a nice touch especially . Make sure to only handle this computer with clean hands because the front cover can get oily pretty fast . I 'm overall very pleased with my new laptop ! ! ! The only downside are the speakers . They do n't go very loud at all . The quality of the sound is nice but the lack of volume really kills it for me . This is mostly not an issue since I mainly use earbuds anyways however it could be annoying at times . The screen looked fine to me and was n't an issue like others have been saying . Overall great for me ! ! !",

                    "context": "I just bought this MacBook Pro a few weeks ago , and the user interface was so simple I got used to my computer in a matter of days , rather than the year it took for me to master Microsoft Windows 7 . Boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute . Apps launch super fast , and the 500GB HDD is more than sufficient . I usually use my Mac for school work and internet browsing , so the entry-level 13 ' MacBook Pro is already more than what I expected from a computer I would typically use it for . Macs hardly ever get viruses , and they are completely incompatible with existing Microsoft Windows Viruses . Furthermore , Mac OS X Mountain Lion 's Gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans , which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed . The keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back-lit , which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing ( Typing ? ) . Overall , the screen resolution , though non-retina , is sufficient for normal web browsing and work . I still do n't get why retina displays are standard on most new iOS devices , but are only available on the MacBook Pro with Retina Display ( Total cheapskate ! ) . The thunderbolt port is awesome ! It 's 10gbps transfer speeds surpass even the super-fast USB 3.0 ( Which also comes with the MBP ) . US 3.0 comes with the MBP and has transfer rates of up to 5gbps . Other ports include FireWire 800 , Gigabit Ethernet , MagSafe port , Microphone jack . SDHC card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs . The glass track pad is large enough for Apple 's highly acclaimed multi-touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers , zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers , accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers . You can also buy one of Apple 's magic mice , which connect to your Mac using Bluetooth , and also allows you to use certain multi-touch gestures such as zoom and scroll . For Windows users switching to a Mac , you can also enable right clicking ( known to apple as secondary click ) in the system preferences > Mouse and enabling right clicking . The unique to apple aluminium uni-body is a real beauty . It makes the MBP very durable and protects it from scratches , though you should n't go launching it against a wall for the sake of trying it . For Windows users who are used to using Microsoft Office , you can buy a license for the latest Microsoft Office software for Mac ( Currently 2011 ) at any of apple 's retail stores , Apple Authorised resellers , any store that sells Microsoft Office for Mac or downloading the software directly from Microsoft 's website . *Users without an optical drive can skip the installation of Microsoft Office and head to the next section* To install the software , simply insert the disc provided in the package into the optical drive and open and install all the files . Enter your code printed on the back of your CD sleeve when prompted . Done ! Enjoy using Microsoft Office ! *For those without an optical drive ( MBP with Retina Display and MB air ) , read this . Users with and optical drive can skip this section* To download Microsoft Office , go to Microsoft 's website and download the trial version . When prompted , enter your code printed on the back of your CD sleeve to unlock the full potential of Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac . The Mac app store and iTunes store are phenomenal . The Mac app store is your one-stop shop for Mac software , though you can also download software online at your own risk . There are currently around 10,000 apps on the App store ( and counting ... ) , and billions of songs available for download fro the iTunes store . iTunes is also you default ( And also your only ) media player besides DVD player , or any other media players you may come across on the internet . iTunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it 's simple to use User Interface . Users switching from a PC will definitely prefer iTunes to Microsoft 's Windows media player . Overall , the high price of the MacBook Pro may convince users to buy a cheaper Windows PC instead . But remember , you are paying a high premium for a product with better build quality and high quality software , which is a joy to work with , considering that you can finally work in peace without having to worry about the millions of Windows viruses out in the wild attacking countless careless and oblivious PC users . I 'm sure you wo n't regret making this purchase .",

All of her professors and instructors use Macintosh . Knowing that I am a Mac fan-boy , it was a no-brainer that she asked me for this as a Christmas present . When the MacBook Pro arrived , I helped her transfer all of her schoolwork from the PC to the Mac ... an easy drag-and-drop process utilizing a flash drive . It was delivered with 4GB of RAM -- 2GB on each of two sticks -- which was probably adequate . However , I always recommend at least 8 gigs , so I ordered 8 gigs from Amazon . When the RAM arrived , all 8 gigs were on one stick . So I simply pulled one 2GB stick from the machine and installed the 8GB stick in its place . The machine now has 10 gigs of RAM and it works just fine . But , hey , it 's an Apple . I would n't expect anything less !",

Three years ago I had purchased this bad boy and it still runs great ! If I were to have any technical difficulties , the local apple and contact line were able to help me asap , it was quite impressive . I myself had purchased the 750 gig drive laptop and as a DJ with thousands of songs , pictures , and other things ... and after 3 years I have managed to fill around 9 % of my gigs . There is SO MUCH ROOM ! Pros 1 . Amazing storage ( both 500gig and 750gig ) 2 . 8 gig ram needed if you are as productive as I am ( DJ , photography , movie making , etc ) its quick ! 3 . No anti spyware needed , never had a virus and I never will 4. build solid and durable 5. bought the 3 year warranty and boy it was needed ( because of my doings ) Cons . 1 . If you fall behind in updates , your laptop will become progressively slower , just update it ... then its back to normal 2 . Sometimes when I stared mine up it would take a few extra minutes to boot on , other times it is a few seconds 3 . Can not manually take battery out , unless you work for apple or have the tools Overall , it is a fantastic laptop . Mine has been though hundreds of parties , weddings , quinces , anything involving performances , it can take it ! This laptop was made for art , music , beat-making , pictures , movies , graphic design . By the way , it comes with apps and hardware that can already support what I had just listed . This laptop will last you a half decade if not a full decade . Soon I will be hitting the 5 year mark and I think this thing can make it another 5 in my opinion . Get this now ! ! ! By the way ... I paid for this particular laptop roughly 2 grand ... LOOK AT THE PRICE NOW !",

Have used windows for years , so switching takes a little adjustments but once you get used to it , you wo n't feel like going back . Also , the laptop is quite , no more burnt laps , best screen display , and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over . Considered MAcBook Air also before buying this Pro , but glad bought the Pro , because I did n't fancy carrying a bunch of adapters , separate DVD player etc ... .. Honestly did n't see too much difference visually between this screen and the retina display , so did n't fancy paying that much premium for retina , others may fancy that , I did n't . Compared other ultrabooks like Zenbook and the price were very comparable but none of them carry the reputation of Mac , so stuck with Macbook Only thing I dislike is that everything for Mac is expensive but I guess you pay for quality !",

I had heard people speak highly of the MacBook Pro for college students , and have not been disappointed through two and a half years of extensive use . The MacBook Pro is useful for college students for many reasons : It is the cheapest product in the line of MacBook 's The new operating system called Snow Leopard is installed and ready for use The battery life has increased from the last version from 4 hours to 7 hours , making it easy for college students to study for extended periods of time without needing a charger . The criteria that I used to evaluate the MacBook Pro ranges from Reliability to simple Usability : Reliability : Throughout the past few years , I have had no problems with the MacBook Pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws . Durability : My computer has fallen from small heights and has had a few spills on it , but has had no lasting damage to the console with only a light plastic case on it . There are also many carrying cases to purchase to have extra protection . Visibility : The screen has brightness settings that can be changed to fit different peoples needs , also the retina display is available for an extra cost if students need a higher quality of display . Usability : The MacBook Pro is very easy to use and can be used by someone who does n't necessarily have extensive knowledge on computers . The processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly . The MacBook Pro has a significant amount of positive attributes that greatly outweigh the negative attributes : Pros : o It usually runs very smoothly , but Apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers . o It is very cost efficient for college students compared to other options . o It has an extended battery life . o It is extremely user friendly . Cons : o Some people do n't enjoy the way the processing system runs , but do n't have any issues with getting it to function . o Others have problems with the applications depending what they need to use the device for , for example engineering majors need extra applications & systems to do some work , but they are easily downloadable . I hope my customer review has been useful , feel free to respond with opinions or feedback about the content of my review .",

The touchscreen is responsive and even works with my crappy dollar stylus . The only problem I have is with windows 8 . I hate windows 8 . It made me sign up with Microsoft and sometimes wo n't let me download things that are harmful to my computer , but that 's what anti virus software is for lol . The wifi rumor has n't happened to me . The wifi works great . I think it 's because I always download my windows updates as reccomended . It feels very well built . The metal is very expensive feeling . The laptop is a little more than an inch thick when closed . I 'm a very weak girl and I could lift this laptop with one hand , however I 'd get tired soon lol . The 15.6 \" screen is not good for carrying around in your bare hands . I suggest getting a case . The waterfly cases are very good .",

I received a dud and have had nothing but problems since right after I purchased this horrible machine . Within the first few months that I bought it , there was clearly a problem with the hard drive . I had been in a training program and had only used Word on it . I went through all of the customer service options . The online customer service was awful . Gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile . No one would ever answer my question as to why I could n't get another new Macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my Macbook was still under warranty . As a matter of fact , no matter how many times I asked that question , the employees I spoke purposely ignored it . They did n't say yes and they did n't say no , they just pretended that I never asked it , which was incredibly frustrating . I 've been to the \" genius \" bar several times ( they have been very nice ) . They have now basically replaced everything inside my machine , told me there was a problem with the hardware , so I now have a \" refurbished \" machine . Maybe I 'm not being reasonable , but I do n't feel that 's the same as a new computer because I did n't pay for a refurbished computer . I still have weird freezing problems with it and it 's pretty slow , but it 's not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in . I had delusions of grandeur regarding Apple 's \" great customer service \" and the \" reliability of their machines \" etc.. etc ... blah ... blah ... I do n't love PCs , but every PC I 've ever owned has lasted longer than this Macbook , which costs much more than any of those Pcs . I 'm sure most people 's Macbooks work just fine , but FYI , if you get the factory dud , you 're stuck with it and no one at Apple cares or will give a hoot about the money you threw away .",

I had to decide if I was going to make a financial commitment to Windows , upgrade , buy new , change . I decided NO ! Enough was enough . I was tired or hodge lodge of software products , security updates , malware , junk and endless upgrade trauma with Windows . I did upgrade my old PC to Windows 7 , but I went with a MacBook Pro and I am very happy . One OS for this platform , no OEM OS paraphernalia and automatic updates . I am happy with the feel the speed and the seamless transition to the MAC !

I told her \" real men \" use PC 's because of the challenge it keeps you sharp technically . Her final response was \" whatever \" ! Well she was right , Whatever in the world took me so long to get a computer that just works . I 'm no power user , but I have had no learning curve with the MAC and I do n't do anything geeky enough forcing me to learn the OS . I did buy Office 2008 for the MAC at a very low price to migrate most of my work files for $ 64 and that was a steal in my opinion . Otherwise I am happily a Mac user .",

                    "context": "For a premium laptop sold in 2013 , the Apple MacBook Pro ( 13 inch , base model ) is about as basic as it gets : no SSD , no discrete graphics , no 1080p display , and no touch screen . But Apple does not pretend it has any of these . What it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side , Apple 's OSX Mountain Lion , the sleek looks Apple always delivers , reasonable specs , good battery life , nice keyboard , and excellent trackpad . Now , the question is , who is this computer for ? Those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag , and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use Macs . The average computer user will be served better by a Macbook Air , since it is faster ( for basic tasks ) , lighter , and has a higher-res antiglare screen . The MacBook Pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac , but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution . This Mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair . Hard drives can be replaced  , RAM can be added as needed , and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge . The processor is roughly 15 % faster than the one inside the Macbook Air , which also extends this computer 's usable lifespan . The fact that the screen is fairly low-res for the price ( MBP 13 has a res of 1280x800 , while other windows laptops have a res of 1600x900 for the same price ) , really detracts from my personal experience with the computer . The retina display of my iPhone 5 has indeed spoiled me , and Apple should update the screen of the MBP 13 or bring down the price of the retina model . This , added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money , detracts from the computer 's value . Lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five-star purchase , but for the price , this is a four star ( good ) computer . Those looking to drop $ 1200 on a new laptop will have to decide if the upgradability and processor performance is worth the money over the sleeker MacBook Air . In addition , if Mac OSX is not something you enjoy using , then I would advise that you look elsewhere for a laptop . TLDR version : good , reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive .",

I was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase . I have never been to a genius bar since my first purchase ( 1984 ) . This machine has made me go there 5 times and has been nothing but a continuous problem . Finally , they are sending it in for a motherboard replacement . ( It 's a lemon ) . So , I 'm cooled on Mac buys . I guess those Chinese workers really are unhappy . Update November 1 , 2012 ... On my last visit to the Genius Bar they sent the machine in to replace the motherboard . It came back today . They did not replace the motherboard . Instead they 'tightened ' a loose wire . It also has a big new scratch on the top cover . I started it up and it still has the same problem I went in to fix . So I 'm going back to Genius Bar for visit # 6 . I think it may have to be 'Apple Do n't Care ' instead of Apple Care .",

I have used this product for only 2 days , but I ca n't wait to use it more . I really like Mac/Apple products because of their operating system . I have been a Linux ( Ubuntu and Fedora ) user for a while because Windows does n't appeal to me and it is similar to Ubuntu and Fedora but with trackpad gestures , notification center , and I can run iTunes ( I could n't get it to run on Linux ) . I can tweet and use Facebook from the sidebar which is really nice . I also like I have the option to push calendars , photos , and contacts to an iPad , iPod Touch , or iPhone ( if I had any of those ) . The only thing I have had trouble with so far is transferring music to iTunes which I would have liked to do though \" Home Sharing \" ( I used iTunes on a computer separate from my Linux computer ) but I could not figure that out . I just ended up using my iPod to transfer my iTunes music and I re-downloaded my Amazon music ( losing my ratings ) . I would recommend this product to anyone having trouble typing on their iOS products , though there are cheaper options ; any new computer users , as it is easy to learn ; and anyone who needs to be efficient , as the gestures make it very easy to multitask . I have not tried gaming on it but I have heard that Mac/Apple does not do games well . I plan on using my MacBook Pro for a long time .",

If the price does n't deter you , you 'll find it well worth it in terms of trouble-free operation . I 've had it for more than a year , and I 've found that no anti-virus software is needed , as long as you do n't download anything without being 100 % sure that it 's from a legitimate source . ( Updates and plug-ins should also be treated with caution ; it 's a good idea to Google first and see whether other users have had problems with these items . ) From time to time I get the 'spinning beach ball ' that holds up progress . I can almost always fix that quickly by clicking on the 'Show all bookmarks ' icon ( the open book icon at the upper left ) . Once in a long while that does n't work ; in that case I turn the computer off , then on again , and sign in -- problem solved . I 'll leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself , and just conclude by saying that I 'm delighted with my purchase . P.S . : A friend who knows a great deal about computers started with Windows ; then he bought a Mac Mini . For a time he used both ; now he uses his Mac exclusively . 'Nuff said ?",
