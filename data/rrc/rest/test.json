The food was all good but it was way too mild . Normally , places ask how hot you want it , but they did n't . I should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild . I will give them another chance and make sure to tell them to kick it up several notches . The naan was some of the best I 've had and I really enjoyed the bhartha , not too tomatoey . Even the chickpeas , which I normally find too dry , were good . And they packaged everything nicely so it did n't spill .",

Also , they serve THE best hummus in America , with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil ( which , I believe is the traditional way ) ! The only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service .

We waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 1/2 hours for our food . I swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal . HOWEVER , one Sunday afternoon my husband and I did go ( although with my loud protests ) and were pleasantly surprised . The band was very good and the service was attentive . Outside in the area between the restaurant and the park , children were running around while their parents sipped wine . We ordered a selection of the small plates , and the shoe string onions , goat cheese pizza , grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good . It was like dining at a completely different restaurant . We have since returned and also had a great experience , sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer ( cold and good ) . We did have the same waiter the second time , so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good . Sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun .",

What may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the owners of this establishment . This establishment really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS \" DINERS , DRIVE-INS , AND DIVES \" hosted by Guy Fieri , in which Schooner or Later was subject of . Perhaps now , Scooner or Later falls into the \" Dive \" category . This is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat .

Food was good and cheap . I had the kafta plate and I enjoyed it . It was so much though that I could barely finish but I did , since it was delicious . Atmosphere was nice . Service was kind of slow , our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it was n't that busy . Still I would recommend this place . BTW , I really like Long Beach .

The restaurant was 80 % full and there was a sign posted \" wait to be seated . \" Well I guess it 's hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff . We stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us . Finally , my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked , \" Are you waiting for a table ? \" Once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal . The prior reviews said Kid friendly ... give me a break with two young children that is light years . The Caesar salad I ordered had so much lemon I could n't eat it . The pizza was slightly reminescent of Baker 's Beach pizza which occupied the the space years ago ( a distant second ) . It was decent but nothing exceptional . This establishment is consistent with my feelings of the rest of Chow Foods group . We used to frequent most of their restaurants but over the years each one has really been disapointing . I 'm a born and bred Southend resident and was excited to hear of this restaurant opening . Well , I guess maybe it might be beneficial for the management to pay a visit to Tutta Bella in Columbia City for some tips .",

Even then , the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items . We had a very hard time getting the waitress ' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager . As it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20 % discount on our bill . When the bill came , he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks . It was clear he didn \u2019 t really care . With so many great breakfast/lunch places in So Cal , this one is not worth the wait or any extra effort to visit .",

I never heard back from anyone more than a month ago . After telling my friend about the situation he said lets try again but we will visit the lower bar . After sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she 'd be right with us . We left without ever getting service .

First off , the food came fast and all together : ) i like that ... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other . so about the prawns , they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter ... soooo good ... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty . yummy . best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted . next one that we ordered were prawns and scallop with brocolli . the brocollis were so fresh and tasty . i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time , every piece was as eventful as the first one ... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked . not chewy at all . for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee ... oh la la yummy ! ! ! melt in your mouth . we are for sure coming back to this restaurant . every month if possible . it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel ... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss , esp if your in downtown san jose .",

So for the 'after beach excursion ' , we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to Park Chalet . The restaurant was busy , however there were a few tables open . We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it 'd be a 30 minute wait . So here we are , my wife , 3 year old daughter and I trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building ( where the murals and artifacts are ) . 30 minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off . We went back to the restaurant and low and behold , we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago ! ! Logic behind that ? None that I can think of . We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers , the food did n't arrive until 45 minutes later ... WITH OUR MAIN COURSE . Um so now what are appetizers for ? ? ? Oh I forgot to mention that they do n't have bread service . Its a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag . My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water ( she had a sore throat ) and I guess that since it was only water , it was n't a priority for them to actually bring it . In other words , if they are n't making $ $ off of you then you do n't rate high on their 'service scale ' . Food wise , its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n't a fancy place . The upside of the restaurant ? If I needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or Golden Gate park . Its great if you spent the day there and did n't want to drive to eat . Parking is reasonably good , they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby . Another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides . I 'd hate for tourists to go to Park Chalet and think that this is how all San Francisco restaurants are like .",

As usual the omikase did n't disappoint in freshness , although it scored low on creativity and selection . Their specialty rolls are impressive , though I ca n't remember what we had .

While this diner had reasonably good food , the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence , and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service . As part of a small party of four , our food was dropped off without comment ; any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table . When we finally were able to flag someone down , it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food , who was also not the same person who had taken our order . After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress , a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant . A brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment -- to say we had been \" blown off \" would be an understatement . The manager continually interrupted with \" Is there anything else I can do for you ? \" , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience . She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage , but we could hardly take her promise seriously , seeing as she had n't bothered to get the waitresses name . In short , Schooner or Later could n't have cared less about our being at their establishment . Next time we will go somewhere else , or try other restaurants close by like Mimi 's Cafe and Claim Jumper .",

When I walked in , I was taken aback by their incredible wood decor . The music playing was very hip , 20-30 something pop music , but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat , which became annoying midway through dinner . We were quickly seated and requested the special dinner , which came with : 1 ) Shellfish and Shrimp appetizer or Caesar Salad , 2 ) 9 oz steak ( with a single potato chip ) , and 3 ) homemade donut holes . I got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright . It was n't the freshest seafood ever , but the taste and presentation was OK . Before the steak came , the server told us that the steak did not come with any sides and suggested I pick something from the menu . I picked the asparagus , which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared . It was steamed and tossed with garlic . The 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great , at least initially . The steak was done to my exact liking ( medium rare ) and was nice and juicy . It ? s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction , though both were indistinguishable in taste . Though , one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the steak . My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ? MSG ? taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant . Finally , the homemade donut holes were served for desert . They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and not-too-sweet . The desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner . The dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip , almost $ 50/pp after tax and tip ( about average ) . But the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly . Overall , I would go back and eat at the restaurant again . Just remember to dress a little urban-chic so you don ? t look too far out of place .",

The service was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters . The food was very good , filet mignon was probably the best I 've ever try . The portions are big though , so do not order too much . Groovy music made the dinner casual . The most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places . I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd . The bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink , the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser . There were 3 bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink . I felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom .",

The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu . To start off , approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $ 3 . They serve it in a tall , skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket . I should have just asked for the check when I saw that ; but their menu was so unique that I continued . The pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 \" pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 \" ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over-priced . The pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 \" ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings . The flavors were good but I have had far better pancakes at a German pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger . On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if I had n't rejected the meal all together . I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue . To their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was . In the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( I had water ) . This was 2 times what the same meal would have cost at Le Peep . Snooze provided an inventive pancake offering , but Le Peep would have provided better service and quality .",

Ray 's is something of a Seattle institution , but given its gorgeous Sound views , I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service . Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Ray 's ! To start things off , our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order . My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , Ray 's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce . For my entr\u00e9e , I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard , artichoke hearts , fennel , and pecorino toscano . The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique ( not to mention tasty ) . My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans . I had a taste of all three items on her plate , and they were superb . Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but I did remain puzzled by one issue : Who thinks that Ray 's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ? Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner ... they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table . Given that Ray 's is a seafood restaurant ... well , you get the idea ... All considered , I have to say that Ray 's Boathouse is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution . While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one . Oh yeah ... the view was good , too .",
